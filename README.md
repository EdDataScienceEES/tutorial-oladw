# Data Visualisation: Creating Interactive Figures with Plotly

This repository is contains the resources for a tutorial on creating interactive data visualsiations using Plotly in R. [View the tutorial here](https://eddatascienceees.github.io/tutorial-oladw/).


## Repository Structure
The repository is organised into three main folders

- `data/`: Contains the data files used in the tutorial. 
  - `npmshabitatsamples_2015to2022.csv`: This CSV file contains the National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) data from 2015 to 2022, including survey observation details such as habitat type, date of observation, and geographical coordinates. This data is publically available at the [NPMS website](https://www.npms.org.uk/article/npms-2022-data-published).
- `figures/`: Includes the output figures generated by the code, embedded in the tutorial.
- `script/`: Contains the code used to generate the visualisations.

## Conclusion
By following this tutorial, you will learn how to create interactive visualizations that allow users to explore data dynamically. Feel free to explore the code, customize the visualizations, and experiment with your own datasets.
